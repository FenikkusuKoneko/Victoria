## 🔧`What Is It?`
Victoria is a Lavalink wrapper for Discord.NET library. It is better than Sharplink and Lavalink.Net and provides more features than both of the combined. It also supports almost all of the Lavalink features and keeps up with Lavalink features and updates.

## 💡 `I Want X Feature In Victoria!`
You can open an issue and describe your feature with massive details and make sure your feature is required on global scale.

## 🚀 `I Like Victoria! How Can I Support Her?!`
GREAT! SMASH THAT :star: BUTTON, HIT THE :eyes: (watch) BUTTON. Or, you can [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Yucked) for my hardwork.
OR you can spread the word about Victoria. None of them are necessary but it would be greatly appreciated.
